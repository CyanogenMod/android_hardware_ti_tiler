/**
 * Memory Allocator is responsible for: 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Allocate 1D and 2D blocks and pack them into a buffer. 
 * <li>Free such allocated blocks 
 * <li>Map 1D buffers into tiler space 
 * <li>Unmap 1D buffers from tiler space 
 * <li>Verify if an address lies in 1D or 2D space, whether it 
 * is mapped (to tiler space) 
 * <li>Mapping Ducati memory blocks to host processor and vice 
 * versa. 
 * </ol> 
 *  
 * The allocator distinguishes between: 
 * <ul> 
 * <li>1D and 2D blocks 
 * <li>2D blocks allocated by MemAlloc are non-cacheable.  All 
 * other blocks are cacheable (e.g. 1D blocks).  Preallocated
 * may or may not be cacheable, depending on how they've been 
 * allocated, but are assumed to be cacheable. 
 * <li>buffers (an ordered collection of one or more blocks 
 * mapped consecutively) 
 * </ul> 
 *  
 * The allocator tracks each buffer based on (addr, size). 
 *  
 * Also, via the tiler manager, it tracks each block.  The tiler 
 * manager itself also tracks each buffer.
